          Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the northeastern city of
          Izium has become the latest location where the Russians have left
          behind mass graves.

          televised address, adding that confirmation would likely come Friday.
          "Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for
          it. The world must bring Russia to real responsibility for this war.”

            The Associated Press reported that its journalists saw the site in a
            forest outside Izium on Thursday. A mass grave had a marker saying
            it contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers. It was surrounded
            by hundreds of individual graves with only crosses to mark them.

            Sergei Bolvinov, a senior investigator for Ukrainian police in the
            Kharkiv region, told Sky News of Britain that a pit with more than
            440 bodies was found near Izium after the Russians were driven away.
            He described the grave as “one of the largest burial sites in any
            one liberated city.”

            The Biden administration said it will send another $600 million in
            military aid to Ukraine, trying to boost Kyiv’s counteroffensive
            with some of the same weapons that have helped defeat Russian forces
            in parts of the east and south:

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not sustain any serious
            injuries when his vehicle was struck by another one early Thursday
            after a battlefield visit, his spokesman said. The driver of the
            other vehicle received first aid and was taken away by ambulance,
            the spokesman said.

            Air raid sirens went off twice in Kyiv while Zelenskyy met Thursday
            with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, who
            reiterated the EU's support for Ukraine.

            The U.N. atomic agency’s 35-nation Board of Governors passed a
            resolution Thursday calling on Russia to immediately end its
            occupation of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia,
            where shelling of the facility and nearby areas in recent weeks
            heightened fears of a possible radiation disaster.
